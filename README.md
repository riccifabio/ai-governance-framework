# AI Governance Framework

This repository contains a practical framework designed to support
**AI-related decisions in organizations**, with a focus on governance,
responsibility, and ethical risk.

It is intended for situations where automation affects people,
accountability is unclear, and trade-offs cannot be avoided.

---

## When to use this framework

Use this framework when:
- evaluating or procuring AI systems
- introducing automation in sensitive contexts
- responsibility and decision ownership are unclear
- ethical, legal, and operational concerns intersect

---

## How it works

1. Define the decision context
2. Apply the checklist questions
3. Make disagreements explicit
4. Document the decision and its rationale
5. Revisit the decision over time

---

## What this framework is not

This framework is not:
- a certification
- a compliance checklist
- a scoring system to label systems as “ethical”

It is a **decision-support tool**, not a moral judgment.

---

## Status

Current version: **v1.0 (initial public release)**  
This framework is usable and evolving.
